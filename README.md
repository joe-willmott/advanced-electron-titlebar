# Custom Electron titlebar
A custom Electron titlebar with high customizability.
Current features:  
- Create menus and submenus with ease just from an Object
- Connect a method to the click of a submenu button
- Custom titlebar background color, title label color, buttons hover color
- Automatic shrink - if the window is too narrow to display the whole menu bar, then it is shrunk and the hidden ones are put in a submenu of a button with dots (Similar to VS Code)
- Currently Fontawesome is used for icons on the titlebar so it will look the same on all platforms
